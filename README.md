# USEC - University Startup Entrepreneurial Competition

A modern, interactive hero section featuring particle text animations for the University Startup Entrepreneurial Competition.

## Features

âœ¨ **Interactive Text Particles**: Hover over the "USEC" text to see particles repel and reform
ðŸŽ¨ **Modern Design**: Clean, professional layout with Tailwind CSS
ðŸ“± **Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
ðŸŽ­ **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced with Framer Motion for elegant transitions
âš¡ **High Performance**: Optimized canvas rendering for smooth 60fps animations

## Components

### TextParticle
A reusable component that converts text into interactive particles:

```tsx
<TextParticle
  text="USEC"
  fontSize={160}
  particleColor="#3b82f6"
  particleSize={1.5}
  particleDensity={6}
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>
```

**Props:**
- `text`: The text to render as particles
- `fontSize`: Size of the text (default: 160)
- `particleColor`: Color of the particles (default: "#3b82f6")
- `particleSize`: Size of individual particles (default: 1.5)
- `particleDensity`: Spacing between particles (default: 6)
- `backgroundColor`: Canvas background color (default: "transparent")

### HeroTextParticles
The main hero section component featuring the USEC branding and particle animation.
